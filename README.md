# Hoodoo Guides

## Overview

This is a collection of pages all providing various guides to Hoodoo, in the manner of [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org). The site is automatically published at [http://pond.github.io/hoodoo/](https://pond.github.io/hoodoo/) whenever the `gh-pages` branch receives a commit.

## Jekyll

This repository works through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and takes advantage of GitHub Page's [integration with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/), so you edit Markdown files but you browse HTML files with the same leafname.

Use:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

...to run a local server on port 4000 for previewing edits.

## Acknowledgements

Some of the configuration and file/folder arrangement uses ideas from [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). The `_sass/syntax.scss` file is the `github` theme from [Pygments CSS](https://richleland.github.io/pygments-css/). The main page font comes from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) and decorations come from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Many thanks to all!
