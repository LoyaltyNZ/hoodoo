# Contributions

## Requirements

We love getting pull requests for new features or fixes! Please keep the following in mind:

* Contributions can't be accepted without tests or necessary documentation updates.
* Hoodoo requires 100% RSpec and RDoc test coverage (see the coverage report in `coverage` and issue `bundle exec rake rerdoc` to re-generate RDoc data to check your coverage if you've added any new methods).
* Please follow the prevailing coding style, strange though it might seem, when making changes.
* When submitting a pull request, the more detail you can provide in the pull request body, the better. It helps us understand your intentions and more efficiently and accurately review the pull request.

## Workflow

TBD, but likely to be similar to that for Jekyll.
